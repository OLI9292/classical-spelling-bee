## Classical Spelling Bee

Classical Spelling Bee is a vocabulary acquisition game based on Latin roots.

The app is built using React Native and Firebase.  Services such as WordParsingService.js and QuestionListParsingService.js deconstruct data from Firebase to save as JSON in AsyncStorage.

Game data is controlled in App.js, while the actual game dynamics are controlled in Game.js.
